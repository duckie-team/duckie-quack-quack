### Introduce

QuackQuack is a design system to be used in [Duckie](https://github.com/sungbinland/duckie-android), and it consists of a total of 5 modules.

- `ui-components`: QuackQuack designed composable collection
- `lint-core`: Lint for all codebases
- `lint-quack`: Lint that recommends using QuackQuack UI components
- `lint-compose`: Lint for Jetpack Compose codebase
- `lint-writing`:  Lint for UX Writing (WIP)

QuackQuack is a work in progress, and each lint rule used in the project will be documented soon.
You can check why QuackQuack was born on the [Duckie Tech Blog](https://medium.com/duckie-stories/%EB%8D%95%ED%82%A4%EC%9D%98-%EB%94%94%EC%9E%90%EC%9D%B8-%EC%8B%9C%EC%8A%A4%ED%85%9C-%EA%BD%A5%EA%BD%A5-%EC%9D%84-%EC%86%8C%EA%B0%9C%ED%95%A9%EB%8B%88%EB%8B%A4-59d962c4bf7) (ko).

### Preview

QuackQuack's design components can be previewed by building the Playground module(or [quack-ui.duckie.team](https://quack-ui.duckie.team/)). It will be released on the Google PlayStore soon.

### Usage

WIP

### Download

**Currently, QuackQuack is still in development and has not been released.** When it will be released later, you can download it as follows.

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation(platform("team.duckie.quack:quack-bom:${version}"))

    implementation("team.duckie.quack:quack-ui-components")
    implementation("team.duckie.quack:quack-lint-core")
    implementation("team.duckie.quack:quack-lint-quack")
    implementation("team.duckie.quack:quack-lint-compose")
    implementation("team.duckie.quack:quack-lint-writing")
}
```

### Build

QuackQuack is developed using the latest version of Android Studio Canary. And also requires a build configuration file. Therefore, to build, you need to unzip the `quackuser-secrets.tar` file. You can do it easily with the following command:

```bash
tar xvf quackuser-secrets.tar
```
